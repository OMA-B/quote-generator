# quote-generator

This is just a simple Fetch API project

# What can it do?

1. Fetches quotes from a remote API (https://type.fit/api/quotes)

2. randomly picks one quote to display on 'New Quote' button click

3. a loading animation takes the stage when there is a delay while fetching

4. each quote text displayed can be shared with its respective author when the twitter-icon-inscribed button is clicked
